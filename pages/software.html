					At the Army Research Lab, I've architected
					<a href="https://github.com/EmilyBonar/ADM-AF"
						>software controlling an aerosol deposition machine</a
					>, capable of depositing layers of powder microns thick. The goal of
					this research is to be able to print electrical traces in 3D with
					higher conductivity and strength than ink-based solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started learning LabVIEW shortly after beginning work at ARL in
					2018. About a year later, I achieved the Certified LabVIEW Developer
					certificate from National Instruments and had become the sole
					developer on a large application meant to control the aerosol
					depoisiton machine and all the physical components associated with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I implemented the Actor Framework model to coordinate systems,
					consolidating them from their previous individual apps. This involved
					writing design documents, creating a loosely-coupled messaging
					architechture, and scripting in Python and MATLAB to collect,
					transform, and visualize data.

					Building this website has been a great practical exploration of HTML,
					CSS, and JavaScript. I had a basic understanding of them already, but
					there's no better form of practice than actually making something.
					I've had to deal with build systems, hosting, git, and various other
					problems and solutions that have popped up along the way. Building it
					from scratch, while perhaps more complicated than using a CMS, has
					given me a greater appreciation of what's going on behind the scenes.
				</p>
				<p>
					I set up a build system using
					<a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> that allows me to have a live
					development server of the site. It also, and this is the reason I set
					it up, can inject HTML into static pages before deployment. This is
					very helpful, as it lets me section the header, footer, and so on into
					individual files and reuse code instead of rewriting it. It's always
					helpful for me to have an actual problem to solve when I'm trying to
					learn, and this has been great for teaching me more about Node.js.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following block of code is a part that I had trouble with
					initially, and also the part that I solved on my own, instead of
					getting a package to do it for me. I had a function that would take
					source files, process them, and copy them to the distribution
					directory. But when I didn't need a certain file anymore and deleted
					it from source, my script had no way of knowing to remove it from
					distribution as well. Creating this process to clean the distribution
					directory of unneeded files helped me learn more about globbing and
					working with the filesystem in Node.js, as well as learning when it's
					time to stop searching npm and to just do it myself.
				</p>
				<pre><code>let source = "./src";
let distrib = "./EmilyBonar.github.io/"
function readSrcFiles() {
    srcFileList = glob.sync("**/*", {
        cwd: source,
    });
    return Promise.resolve("cleaned");
}

function readDistFiles() {
    distFileList = glob.sync("**/*", {
        cwd: distrib,
    });
    return Promise.resolve("cleaned");
}
function parseFiles() {
    distFileList.forEach((el) => {
        if (!srcFileList.includes(el)) {
            console.log(del.sync([distrib + el]));
        }
    });
    return Promise.resolve("cleaned");

					I was curious about the named colors in HTML and how to find which one
					was the closest to any input if you wanted to specifically use named
					colors for a design. I couldn't find anything that would answer that
					question to my satisfaction, so I made
					<a href="https://www.emilybonar.com/NearestNamedColor/"
						>Nearest Named Color</a
					>. This tool lets uses JavaScript to let you pick a color and tells
					you the nearest named color in RGB space.
				</p>
				<img
					src="../media/NearestNamed.gif"
					alt="Demonstration of the tool finding the nearest named color"
				/>
				<p>
					Making this was a helpful first step in learning layout, how HTML and
					CSS deal with color, and using Javascript to affect the content of web
					pages. In order to find the nearest color, I used the following code.
					I employed a simple Euclidian distance formula, calculating the color
					distance for all of the 140 named colors in comparison to the one
					color selected. There is probably a more elegant or efficient way of
					calculating this, but it works for this application.
				</p>
				<pre><code>function nearestColor(RGB) {
    let regex = /[0-9]+/g;
    let RGBarray = 
        Array.from(regex[Symbol.matchAll](RGB), 
            (x) => x[0]);
    function distance(RGB1, RGB2) {
        return (
            (RGB2[0] - RGB1[0]) ** 2 +
            (RGB2[1] - RGB1[1]) ** 2 +
            (RGB2[2] - RGB1[2]) ** 2
        );
    }
    let closestColor;
    let dist = 195075;
    for (color in colors) {
        newdist = distance(RGBarray, 
                    colors[color][1]);
        if (newdist < dist) {
            dist = newdist;
            closestColor = color;
        }
    }
    return closestColor;
}</code></pre>

					I've made several very small indie games in the past, usually as
					coding exercises to get used to a new language or framework. I made a
					small rougelike dungeon crawing game called
					<a href="https://bulbasort.itch.io/eevees-birthday"
						>Eevee's Birthday</a
					>
					for the
					<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php"
						>PICO-8 virtual console</a
					>, during which I learned a lot about designing sprites, composing
					(very simple) music, and most importantly, coding in Lua.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also made a small jumping toy called
					<a href="https://github.com/EmilyBonar/Slimes">Slimes</a> in Lua, but
					this time with the <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE game engine</a>.
					It's even simpler than the previous game, but was a good way to
					practice using real tools to build and version control a project. Plus
					I got to make a little animation of a slime bouncing around, and
					that's fun.
