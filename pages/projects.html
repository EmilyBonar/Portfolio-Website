				Building this website has been a great practical exploration of HTML,
				CSS, and JavaScript. I had a basic understanding of them already, but
				there's no better form of practice than actually making something. I've
				had to deal with build systems, hosting, git, and various other problems
				and solutions that have popped up along the way. Building it from
				scratch, while perhaps more complicated than using a CMS, has given me a
				greater appreciation of what's going on behind the scenes.
			</p>
			<p>
				I set up a build system using
				<a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> that allows me to have a live
				development server of the site. It also, and this is the reason I set it
				up, can inject HTML into static pages before deployment. This is very
				helpful, as it lets me section the header, footer, and so on into
				individual files and reuse code instead of rewriting it.

				I was curious about the named colors in HTML and how to find which one
				was the closest to any input if you wanted to specifically use named
				colors for a design. I couldn't find anything that would answer that
				question to my satisfaction, so I made
				<a href="https://www.emilybonar.com/NearestNamedColor/"
					>Nearest Named Color</a
				>. This tool lets uses JavaScript to let you pick a color and tells you
				the nearest named color in RGB space.

				I've made several very small indie games in the past, usually as coding
				exercises to get used to a new language or framework. I made a small
				rougelike dungeon crawing game called
				<a href="https://bulbasort.itch.io/eevees-birthday">Eevee's Birthday</a>
				for the
				<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php"
					>PICO-8 virtual console</a
				>, during which I learned a lot about designing sprites, composing (very
				simple) music, and most importantly, coding in Lua.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also made a small jumping toy called
				<a href="https://github.com/EmilyBonar/Slimes">Slimes</a> in Lua, but
				this time with the <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE game engine</a>.
				It's even simpler than the previous game, but was a good way to practice
				using real tools to build and use version control for a project.
