				<p>
					At the Army Research Lab, I've architected software controlling an
					aerosol deposition machine, capable of depositing layers of powder
					microns thick.

				<h3 class="clickable" tabindex="0">Sinter Cracking</h3>
				<p>
					I worked in the Cordero Additive Lab at Rice University researching
					cracking during constrained sintering. Sintering is the process by
					which particles merge together by the application of heat or pressure
					without melting.

				<h3 class="clickable" tabindex="0">Nickel Alloy Development</h3>
				<p>
					In college, my capstone project was to design an alloy that was easy
					to weld, had a high yield strength and corrosion resistance, and had
					less than 5% dilution from the substrate metal for use in
					corrosion-resistant alloy cladding.
				</p>

				<h3 class="clickable" tabindex="0">Personal Projects</h3>
				<p>
					I've made several personal projects, including this website! I enjoy
					making things from scratch (or close to it) and learning new languages
					and tools. I'm always looking for new projects that I could contribute
					to or things I should check out, so if you have something to tell me
					let me know through the contact links below!
