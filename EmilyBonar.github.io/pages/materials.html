					While working at the Army Research Lab, I have designed, had
					fabricated, and tested physical components using Solidworks 3D
					modelling. The most notable example is a new nozzle assembly, which I
					took from concept to final product installed in the machine, with
					multiple swappable nozzles to deposit lines of different thicknesses.

					I worked in the Cordero Additive Lab at Rice University researching
					cracking during constrained sintering. Sintering is the process by
					which particles merge together by the application of heat or pressure
					without melting.

				<p>
					During this process, the density of the material increases, typically
					from around 30% density to 50-90%. If the piece being sintered is
					constrained or has a complex shape, this shrinkage can lead to
					cracking.
				</p>
				<p>
					I designed samples and a frame to hold and constrain them in
					Solidworks, then 3D printed the the samples myself out of alumina on
					an ExOne binderjet printer. I then set up a camera focused into a tube
					furnace where the samples and frames were heated to 1000+ degrees
					Celcius, took pictures every few seconds, and compliled those pictures
					into a movie with ImageJ that could be analyzed to track crack
					formation over time, which you can see below.

				<p>
					In college, my capstone project was to design an alloy that was easy
					to weld, had a high yield strength (> 70ksi) and corrosion resistance
					(comparable to Inconel 625), and had less than 5% dilution from the
					substrate metal for use in CRA (corrosion-resistant alloy) cladding.
					CRA cladding of pipes is cheaper than a solid CRA pipe, and increases
					the pipe lifespan when transporting harsh materials.
				</p>

				<p>
					My group chose to make a nickel-based alloy, due to the fact that
					nickel alloys are already in use for CRA cladding and are highly
					resistant to many forms of corrosion and high temperature oxidation.
					The strengthening mechanisms we chose to use were solid solution
					strengthening (introducing trace elements into the alloy to impede
					dislocation movement) and precipitation hardening (heat treatment).
				</p>
				<p>
					We used two models to predict the yield strength of our alloys, a
					linear model derived from commercial nickel alloy composition and
					strength data, and the Feltham Tough solid-state physics model from
					scientific literature. From these models, we chose to test adding
					Niobium, Tungsten, Aluminum, and Lanthanum to our alloy.
				</p>
				<img src="../media/arc welding.png" alt="" />
				<p>
					A plasma-transferred arc welding machine was used to create our alloys
					out of premixed powders. I wrote low-level G-code to operate the
					welding machine, covering the surface of the steel substrate with our
					nickel alloy.
				</p>
				<p>
					We performed microhardness tests (ASTM E92), tensile tests (ASTM E8),
					and pitting and corrosion tests (ASTM G48). This required extensive
					sample preperation, including grinding and polishing the surface,
					cutting out specimens, and mounting samples in acid.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the end, our alloy, named 625M after Inconel 625 which it was based
					on, achieved most of the goals set for it. It had good weldability,
					high yield strength, and good corrosion reistance. The iron dilution
					ranged from 5-15%, which didn't meet our standard, but that could be
					solved with further research.
