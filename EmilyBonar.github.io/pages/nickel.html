		<main>
			<p>
				In college, my capstone project was to design an alloy that was easy to
				weld, had a high yield strength (> 70ksi) and corrosion resistance
				(comparable to Inconel 625), and had less than 5% dilution from the
				substrate metal for use in CRA (corrosion-resistant alloy) cladding. CRA
				cladding of pipes is cheaper than a solid CRA pipe, and increases the
				pipe lifespan when transporting harsh materials.
			</p>

			<p>
				My group chose to make a nickel-based alloy, due to the fact that nickel
				alloys are already in use for CRA cladding and are highly resistant to
				many forms of corrosion and high temperature oxidation. The
				strengthening mechanisms we chose to use were solid solution
				strengthening (introducing trace elements into the alloy to impede
				dislocation movement) and precipitation hardening (heat treatment).
			</p>
			<p>
				We used two models to predict the yield strength of our alloys, a linear
				model derived from commercial nickel alloy composition and strength
				data, and the Feltham Tough solid-state physics model from scientific
				literature. From these models, we chose to test adding Niobium,
				Tungsten, Aluminum, and Lanthanum to our alloy.
			</p>
			<img src="../media/arc welding.png" alt="" />
			<p>
				A plasma-transferred arc welding machine was used to create our alloys
				out of premixed powders. I wrote low-level G-code to operate the welding
				machine, covering the surface of the steel substrate with our nickel
				alloy.
			</p>
			<p>
				We performed microhardness tests (ASTM E92), tensile tests (ASTM E8),
				and pitting and corrosion tests (ASTM G48). This required extensive
				sample preperation, including grinding and polishing the surface,
				cutting out specimens, and mounting samples in acid.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the end, our alloy, named 625M after Inconel 625 which it was based
				on, achieved most of the goals set for it. It had good weldability, high
				yield strength, and good corrosion reistance. The iron dilution ranged
				from 5-15%, which didn't meet our standard, but that could be solved
				with further research.
